            <p>Hello, I am 45 years old. I have been married for nearly 28 years. I have 4 children and 2
                grandchildren. I spent 16 years in law enforcement, and I am transitioning to a new career
                after being injured on the job. I completed the three certificates in the Information
                Technology path, but I decided that I enjoyed the programming courses more; so, I am pursuing
                a programming degree. I enjoy off-road driving, camping, movies, games, and everything
                computer in my extremely limited spare time. I built my very own computer from scratch when I
                started school with BYU Pathways. I enjoyed it, but it was very expensive. That being said, it
                has been a very capable machine and I have used it to run up to five virtual machines at once while
                I have been working on schooling. It has always been faster than relying on the servers at Ensign
                College. My favorite movie genre is Science Fiction. If you can believe it, I like Star Trek and
                Star Wars (yes it is possible). Don't ask which is my favorite. I love them both. I had to read
                some HTML code last block for my Web Integration class. It was aggravating because we never learned
                anything about it. I found it interesting; so, I look forward to learning more about web design!
            </p>

            <p>Commerce City is a suburb located north of Denver in Colorado. We are 30 minutes from the Capital
                building and about an hour from many outdoor activities in the beautiful Rocky mountains. We
                have
                easy access to big city comforts while retaining access to outdoor recreation. Unfortunately, we
                still
                have to deal with big city problems! </p>
