        <p>Hello, I am 45 years old. I have been married for nearly 28 years. I have 4 children and 2 grandchildren. I
            spent 16 years in law
            enforcement, and I am transitioning to a new career after being injured on the job.
            I completed the three certificates in the Information Technology path, but I decided that I
            enjoyed the programming courses more; so, I am pursuing a programming degree. I enjoy off-road driving,
            camping, movies, games, and everything
            computer in my extremely limited spare time. I look forward to learning more about web design!
        </p>
