                <p>Commerce City is a suburb located north of Denver in Colorado. We are 30 minutes from the Capital
                    building and about an hour from many outdoor activities in the beautiful Rocky mountains. We have
                    easy access to big city comforts while retaining access to outdoor recreation. Unfortunately, we
                    still
                    have to deal with big city problems! </p>

        <p>Hello, I am 45 years old. I have been married for nearly 28 years. I have 4 children and 2
            grandchildren.
            I
            spent 16 years in law
            enforcement, and I am transitioning to a new career after being injured on the job.
            I completed the three certificates in the Information Technology path, but I decided that I
            enjoyed the programming courses more; so, I am pursuing a programming degree. I enjoy off-road
            driving,
            camping, movies, games, and everything
            computer in my extremely limited spare time. I look forward to learning more about web design!
