            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Joseph and Purity Bowen have been residents of Colorado since 2001. They currently reside in Commerce
                City where they are raising their three children (Serenity, Naomi, and Devon). They are heavily
                involved in their community through Karate. All but Devon have achieved their black belts. As the
                youngest, Devon will be achieving his black belt soon. They bring the Black Belt values of dedication,
                service, and fun to everything they do.
            </p>
            <p>In 2010, the Bowen family embarked on the journey of providing safe and engaging entertainment to the
                community by starting Razor's Edge Rafting Company. They started by providing white-water rafting
                trips on Clear Creek in the mountains of Colorado. They have since grown to offer trips on the Colorado
                River, the Eagle River, and the Blue River. Whichever river you choose, Razor's Edge has the perfect
                rafting trip for you!
